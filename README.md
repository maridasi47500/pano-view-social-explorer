🌀 Concept Summary: "Pano View Social Explorer"

A hybrid system that combines panoramic imagery, social media post data (real or simulated), and geolocation-based sport/travel activities. It’s like a visual diary meets a dynamic map of experiences.
🧩 Core Elements
🔘 Circular & Square Visuals

    Circle: Represents a panoramic view (e.g., sea, city, nature).

    Square: Represents a social media post linked to that pano view.

        Posts can be real or simulated.

        Includes metadata like popularity, hashtags, and engagement.

🗃️ Database Tables (Real or Fake)
Table Name	Description
PanoViews	Stores panoramic images with location tags and timestamps.
SocialPosts	Links to posts (real or fake) showing how popular or styled they are.
ActivityLog	Tracks time spent doing sports near cafes or in nature, expressed in words.
TransportTrails	Logs movement across locations with photos, not just GPS points.
GemRoutes	Highlights scenic or meaningful sport routes (urban, sea, forest, etc.).
🧠 Two Database Plans
📁 Plan A: Mixed Reality Database

    Fake social media data simulates how posts might look or trend.

    Panoramic views are linked to these posts.

    Useful for testing UI, storytelling, or concept design.

📂 Plan B: Real Social Media Integration

    Real database of posts pulled from actual platforms.

    Panoramic views act as a backdrop or context layer behind other photos.

    Ideal for analytics, tourism apps, or immersive storytelling.

🏞️ Bonus Feature: "Distance in Words"

    Instead of raw GPS, the system uses poetic or descriptive language:

        “You spent a breezy hour jogging near the riverside café.”

        “Three golden sunsets passed while you biked through the pine trail.”
